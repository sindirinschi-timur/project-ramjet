## Chapter 2: Vision

In **Project RamJet**, the game is led by the protagonist, referred to as [The Traveler]. **Traveling** is the main activity, allowing the player to explore **The World** using different types of aircraft, known as [Frigates].

**Game Entities:**
- **The World**: A vast space filled with cross-winds, called **Zephyrs**, guided by meteorological conditions defined by **The Elements**. The space is further influenced by a ceiling entity called **The Ether**, which mimics atmospheric pressure.
- **Frigates**: Aircraft used by **The Traveler**. Frigates vary in size, shape, and travel capability, with more powerful versions available for purchase using in-game currency, **Concords**.
- **Concords**: Currency that can be earned through exploration and completing quests. Concords are used to buy equipment, acquire new Frigates, and unlock restricted areas.
- **Sedentars**: Non-player characters who may assist or challenge **The Traveler**. Aligning with **The Sedentary Fate** leads to debuffs or game over.

The ultimate purpose of the game is left for the player to unravel as they progress through the storyline.
